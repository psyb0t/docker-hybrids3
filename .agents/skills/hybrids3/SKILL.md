# hybrids3

Lightweight object storage that speaks three interfaces from one container: the **S3 API** (boto3 / any AWS SDK, AWS Signature V4), a **plain HTTP API** (`curl` + Bearer token), and **MCP** (Streamable HTTP tool definitions for AI agents). Metadata lives in SQLite, object bytes are flat files on disk.

Buckets are **configuration, not state** — they're defined in the server's `config.yaml` and there is no API to create or delete them. Each bucket carries: a `public`/private flag, a private `key` (Bearer token + S3 signing secret), a `public_key` (the `aws_access_key_id` identifier), an optional `ttl` (objects auto-expire after last write), and an optional `max_file_size`. A single cross-bucket `master_key` operates on every bucket and is the only credential that can list all buckets.

Object keys support nested paths (`reports/2024/jan.pdf`). Content type is auto-detected on upload (libmagic sniff + extension fallback). Presigned GET/PUT URLs hand out time-limited single-object access without exposing a key.

For installation, configuration, and container setup, see [references/setup.md](references/setup.md).

## When To Use

- Put / get / list / delete files in a self-hosted, S3-compatible object store.
- Drive existing boto3 / AWS-SDK code against your own endpoint (change `endpoint_url` + credentials, nothing else).
- Store artifacts, uploads, reports, backups that services and agents read/write.
- Generate a **presigned PUT URL** so a third party can upload one specific key without your bucket key.
- Generate a **presigned GET URL** so a third party can download one private object for a limited time.
- Connect an AI agent to object storage over **MCP** — structured `upload_object` / `download_object` / `list_objects` / etc. tools.
- Auto-expiring scratch storage — set a bucket `ttl` and objects clean themselves up.

## When NOT To Use

- Creating or deleting buckets at runtime — buckets live in `config.yaml`; add/remove them there and restart. `PUT /{bucket}` is an S3-compat no-op.
- Multipart / chunked uploads (S3's multipart protocol) — not implemented. Upload the whole object in one request.
- Object versioning, ACLs beyond bucket-level public/private, replication, or encryption at rest — none are supported.
- Downloading objects **over 50 MB via MCP** — the MCP `download_object` tool caps at 50 MB. Use the S3 or plain HTTP `GET` for large objects.
- CORS from a browser — no CORS headers are emitted; add them at the reverse-proxy layer.
- Provisioning, configuring, or hardening the server itself — this skill is a **consumer**. It talks to an instance the user already runs and trusts.

## Setup

The container should already be running. Point the skill at it:

```bash
export HYBRIDS3_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

**Verify:** `curl $HYBRIDS3_URL/health` returns `{"status":"ok"}`.

Keys are per-bucket and come from the operator's `config.yaml`. Export the ones you'll use rather than pasting them inline:

```bash
export HYBRIDS3_KEY=<bucket-private-key>          # Bearer token / aws_secret_access_key
export HYBRIDS3_PUBLIC_KEY=<bucket-public-key>    # aws_access_key_id (defaults to bucket name)
# For cross-bucket / list-all-buckets operations, use the master credentials instead:
export HYBRIDS3_MASTER_KEY=<master-key>
export HYBRIDS3_MASTER_PUBLIC_KEY=<master-public-key>   # defaults to "master"
```

If the server runs behind a reverse proxy at a subpath, `HYBRIDS3_URL` includes it (e.g. `http://host/storage`) and every route — health included — lives under that prefix.

For install / `config.yaml` shape / bucket + key definitions / ports / reverse proxy, see [references/setup.md](references/setup.md).

## Three Access Modes

One service, three front doors on the **same port** (`8080`). Pick per client:

| Mode | Endpoint | Auth | Reach for it when… |
|---|---|---|---|
| **S3 API** | root (`/`), signed requests | AWS Sig V4 (`public_key` = access key id, `key` = secret) | You already have boto3 / AWS-SDK code, or want SDK ergonomics (pagination, presign helpers, retries). |
| **Plain HTTP** | `/{bucket}/{key}` etc. | `Authorization: Bearer <key>` | Shell scripts, `curl`, quick one-offs. No SDK, no signing — just a Bearer header (and public-bucket reads need none). |
| **MCP** | `POST /mcp/` | per-connection + per-tool `auth_key` | An AI agent should manipulate storage through typed tool calls instead of raw HTTP. |

They share one SQLite metadata store and one flat-file tree — an object written over S3 is readable over plain HTTP and MCP, and vice versa.

## S3 API

S3 clients authenticate with **AWS Signature V4**. The bucket's `public_key` is the `aws_access_key_id` (travels in the request in plaintext, in the `Credential=` field); the bucket's private `key` is the `aws_secret_access_key` (used only to compute the HMAC locally — never transmitted). `region_name` is required by SDKs but the value is arbitrary — use `us-east-1`.

```
Authorization: AWS4-HMAC-SHA256 Credential=uploads-id/20240101/us-east-1/s3/aws4_request, SignedHeaders=host;x-amz-date, Signature=<hmac>
```

### boto3

```python
import boto3
from botocore.config import Config

# per-bucket client — access limited to the "uploads" bucket
s3 = boto3.client(
    "s3",
    endpoint_url="http://localhost:8080",     # HYBRIDS3_URL
    aws_access_key_id="uploads-id",           # bucket public_key
    aws_secret_access_key="uploads-secret",   # bucket key (private)
    region_name="us-east-1",                  # arbitrary but required
    config=Config(signature_version="s3v4"),
)

s3.put_object(Bucket="uploads", Key="file.txt", Body=b"hello")
s3.get_object(Bucket="uploads", Key="file.txt")["Body"].read()
s3.head_object(Bucket="uploads", Key="file.txt")
s3.list_objects_v2(Bucket="uploads", Prefix="images/")
s3.delete_object(Bucket="uploads", Key="file.txt")
s3.list_buckets()                             # bucket key → only "uploads"

# presigned URLs (see MCP / HTTP presign for the same semantics)
get_url = s3.generate_presigned_url(
    "get_object", Params={"Bucket": "permanent", "Key": "doc.pdf"}, ExpiresIn=3600,
)
put_url = s3.generate_presigned_url(
    "put_object", Params={"Bucket": "uploads", "Key": "inbox/report.pdf"}, ExpiresIn=600,
)
```

For cross-bucket access or `list_buckets()` returning **all** buckets, build a second client with the **master** credentials (`aws_access_key_id=master_public_key`, `aws_secret_access_key=master_key`). Don't embed the master key in client-facing code — per-bucket keys scope access to one bucket.

### aws-cli

```bash
aws --endpoint-url "$HYBRIDS3_URL" \
    --region us-east-1 \
    s3api put-object --bucket uploads --key file.txt --body ./file.txt
# credentials via env: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<public_key> AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<key>
```

Supported S3 operations: `put_object`, `get_object`, `head_object`, `delete_object`, `list_objects_v2` (honours `Prefix`), `list_buckets`, `generate_presigned_url` (GET + PUT). Not supported: multipart upload, versioning, ACLs, bucket create/delete (boto3's implicit `create_bucket` maps to a no-op).

## Plain HTTP API

Bearer auth: pass the bucket's private `key` (or the `master_key`) as `Authorization: Bearer <key>`. Public-bucket **reads** (GET/HEAD/LIST) need no auth; **all writes** and **private-bucket reads** require a key.

Requests carrying an AWS Sig V4 `Authorization` header get S3-style XML back; everything else gets JSON. Every response includes `X-Request-Id` (log correlation) and `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`. Errors carry `"error"` + `"request_id"` fields.

### Objects

| Method | Path | Auth | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `PUT` | `/{bucket}/{key}` | write | Upload object. Returns `ETag` (MD5 of content). Content type auto-detected; override with a `Content-Type` header. |
| `GET` | `/{bucket}/{key}` | read | Download object. Returns `ETag`, `Last-Modified`, `Content-Length`. |
| `HEAD` | `/{bucket}/{key}` | read | Object metadata, no body. |
| `DELETE` | `/{bucket}/{key}` | write | Delete object — always `204`, even if absent. |
| `GET` | `/{bucket}` | read | List objects. Query: `prefix`, `max-keys`. |
| `POST` | `/presign/{bucket}/{key}` | write | Generate a presigned URL. Query: `method` (`GET` default / `PUT`), `expires` (seconds, 1–604800, default 3600). |

```bash
# upload
curl -X PUT "$HYBRIDS3_URL/uploads/file.txt" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HYBRIDS3_KEY" \
  --data-binary @file.txt

# upload a nested key (parent dirs created automatically)
curl -X PUT "$HYBRIDS3_URL/uploads/reports/2024/january.pdf" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HYBRIDS3_KEY" \
  --data-binary @january.pdf

# download from a public bucket — no auth needed
curl "$HYBRIDS3_URL/uploads/file.txt"

# download from a private bucket
curl "$HYBRIDS3_URL/permanent/doc.pdf" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HYBRIDS3_KEY"

# list objects with a prefix
curl "$HYBRIDS3_URL/uploads?prefix=images/&max-keys=50" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HYBRIDS3_KEY"

# delete
curl -X DELETE "$HYBRIDS3_URL/uploads/file.txt" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HYBRIDS3_KEY"
```

### Buckets

| Method | Path | Auth | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/health` | none | `{"status":"ok"}` liveness check. |
| `GET` | `/` | master or bucket key | List buckets — master key lists all, bucket key lists only its own. |
| `HEAD` | `/{bucket}` | read | `200` if bucket exists in config, else `404`. |
| `PUT` | `/{bucket}` | write | S3-compat no-op: `200` if bucket exists in config, `404` if not. Creates nothing. |

```bash
# list all buckets — needs the master key
curl "$HYBRIDS3_URL/" -H "Authorization: Bearer $HYBRIDS3_MASTER_KEY"

# a bucket key lists only its own bucket
curl "$HYBRIDS3_URL/" -H "Authorization: Bearer $HYBRIDS3_KEY"
```

### Presigned URLs (HTTP)

`POST /presign/{bucket}/{key}` requires the bucket key or master key. The result grants exactly one verb on exactly one key. A GET URL can't be used to PUT (the method is baked into the signature).

```bash
# presigned GET on a PRIVATE bucket → signed, expiring URL
curl -X POST "$HYBRIDS3_URL/presign/permanent/doc.pdf?expires=3600" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HYBRIDS3_KEY"
# → {"url":"http://.../permanent/doc.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=...&X-Amz-Signature=...","method":"GET","expires":3600}

# presigned GET on a PUBLIC bucket → plain URL, no signature, no expiry (reads are open anyway)
curl -X POST "$HYBRIDS3_URL/presign/uploads/photo.jpg" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HYBRIDS3_KEY"
# → {"url":"http://.../uploads/photo.jpg","method":"GET","expires":null}

# presigned PUT → ALWAYS signed, even for public buckets (anonymous writes are never allowed)
curl -X POST "$HYBRIDS3_URL/presign/uploads/inbox/report.pdf?method=PUT&expires=600" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HYBRIDS3_KEY"

# recipient uploads using only the URL — no Authorization header
curl -X PUT "<presigned-put-url>" --data-binary @report.pdf
```

The bucket's `max_file_size` is enforced server-side during the upload regardless of how it was authenticated (oversized → `413`). Expired or tampered presigned URLs → `403`.

## MCP Endpoint

An MCP server runs at `POST /mcp/` over the **Streamable HTTP** transport. Client config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hybrids3": { "type": "streamable-http", "url": "http://localhost:8080/mcp/" }
  }
}
```

Wire it into Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http hybrids3 "$HYBRIDS3_URL/mcp/"
# with endpoint-level auth:
claude mcp add --transport http hybrids3 "$HYBRIDS3_URL/mcp/" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $HYBRIDS3_MASTER_KEY"
```

### Auth (two layers)

**Endpoint-level (optional)** — a token that authenticates the *connection* before any tool runs. Master key = full access; a bucket key = limited to that bucket. Send it as `Authorization: Bearer <key>`, or (for clients that can't set headers) as `?auth=<key>` on the URL. A token that matches nothing → `401`; **no token → passes through**, and per-tool auth applies.

**Per-tool** — every tool that touches a bucket takes an `auth_key` argument (the bucket's private `key` or the master key), checked independently of the connection token. Public-bucket reads (`download_object`, `list_objects`, `object_info`) accept an empty `auth_key`; all writes and all private-bucket ops require it.

### Tools

| Tool | Args | Auth | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `upload_object` | `bucket`, `key`, `content`, `auth_key`, `content_type=""`, `encoding="utf-8"` | bucket/master key | `encoding="base64"` for binary. Returns `size`, `etag`, `content_type`. |
| `download_object` | `bucket`, `key`, `auth_key=""`, `encoding="utf-8"` | key on private only | `base64` for binary; UTF-8 that won't decode auto-falls back to base64. **Objects > 50 MB rejected — use HTTP.** |
| `delete_object` | `bucket`, `key`, `auth_key` | bucket/master key | Idempotent. |
| `list_objects` | `bucket`, `auth_key=""`, `prefix=""`, `max_keys=100` | key on private only | `max_keys` clamped to 1–1000. |
| `list_buckets` | `auth_key` | master or bucket key | Master lists all; bucket key lists only its own. |
| `object_info` | `bucket`, `key`, `auth_key=""` | key on private only | Metadata only (size, content_type, etag, uploaded_at, expires_at). |
| `presign_url` | `bucket`, `key`, `auth_key`, `method="GET"`, `expires=3600`, `base_url=""`, `host=""` | bucket/master key | `method` GET/PUT. Same public-GET-plain / everything-else-signed logic as the HTTP endpoint. `expires` clamped 1–604800. Set `base_url` to the externally-reachable URL so the link is usable. |

All tools return `structuredContent` with a plain-text fallback. Internal error details are masked.

### Raw JSON-RPC

For debugging or non-MCP callers, POST JSON-RPC directly. The transport requires the `Accept` header below.

```bash
# tools/list
curl -s "$HYBRIDS3_URL/mcp/" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}'

# tools/call — upload
curl -s "$HYBRIDS3_URL/mcp/" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/call",
    "params":{
      "name":"upload_object",
      "arguments":{"bucket":"uploads","key":"note.txt","content":"hello","auth_key":"'"$HYBRIDS3_KEY"'"}
    }
  }'
```

## Authentication (all modes)

| Credential | Config field | Role | Keep secret? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bucket private key | `key` | Bearer token (HTTP/MCP) **and** `aws_secret_access_key` (S3). Signs/verifies — never transmitted. | **Yes** |
| Bucket public key | `public_key` | `aws_access_key_id` (S3) + `Credential=` in presigned URLs. Identifies, grants nothing. Defaults to bucket name. | No |
| Master key | `master_key` | Cross-bucket god key. Works on every bucket + only credential that lists all buckets. | **Yes** |
| Master public key | `master_public_key` | `aws_access_key_id` paired with the master key (S3). Defaults to `"master"`. | No |

Bucket visibility:

| | GET / HEAD / LIST | PUT | DELETE / presign |
|---|---|---|---|
| `public: true` | no auth | bucket key, master key, or valid presigned PUT | bucket key or master key |
| `public: false` | bucket key, master key, or valid presigned GET | bucket key, master key, or valid presigned PUT | bucket key or master key |

Unauthorized or non-existent bucket access always returns `404` — callers can't tell "doesn't exist" from "no access". All key comparisons are constant-time.

## Typical Workflows

### Upload + fetch over plain HTTP

```bash
export HYBRIDS3_URL=http://localhost:8080
export HYBRIDS3_KEY=<uploads-key>

curl -X PUT "$HYBRIDS3_URL/uploads/report.pdf" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HYBRIDS3_KEY" --data-binary @report.pdf
curl -sO "$HYBRIDS3_URL/uploads/report.pdf"     # public bucket → no auth on read
```

Or via the helper (see [`scripts/hybrids3.sh`](scripts/hybrids3.sh)):

```bash
HYBRIDS3_URL=http://localhost:8080 HYBRIDS3_KEY=<key> \
  scripts/hybrids3.sh put uploads report.pdf ./report.pdf
scripts/hybrids3.sh list uploads reports/
scripts/hybrids3.sh get uploads report.pdf ./out.pdf
scripts/hybrids3.sh delete uploads report.pdf
scripts/hybrids3.sh buckets                     # needs HYBRIDS3_KEY=<master-key>
```

### Hand someone a presigned upload URL

```bash
# you generate it (needs a key); they upload with no credentials
curl -X POST "$HYBRIDS3_URL/presign/uploads/inbox/theirs.zip?method=PUT&expires=600" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HYBRIDS3_KEY" | jq -r .url
# → hand the URL over; recipient: curl -X PUT "<url>" --data-binary @theirs.zip
```

### Drop-in boto3 against your own endpoint

Point any existing boto3 code at `HYBRIDS3_URL`, set the bucket's `public_key`/`key` as the credential pair, `region_name="us-east-1"`, `signature_version="s3v4"`. See [S3 API](#s3-api).

### Agent-driven storage over MCP

Add the server (`claude mcp add --transport http hybrids3 "$HYBRIDS3_URL/mcp/"`), then call `list_buckets` to discover buckets, `upload_object` / `download_object` / `list_objects` to move data. Pass the bucket `key` as `auth_key`; use the master key only when you need cross-bucket reach.

### Auto-expiring scratch storage

If a bucket has a `ttl` set (server config), objects delete themselves that long after their last write — overwriting resets the clock. Nothing to do client-side; just write to the bucket.
